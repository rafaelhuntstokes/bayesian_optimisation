# Scintillation Emission Model Calibration using Bayesian Optimisation

This optimisation package was developed to improve the efficiency of calibrating
the SNO+ scintillation photon emission timing models. Scintillation photons are
generated according to a probabilty distribution, given empirically by:

$$ x = 4 $$
